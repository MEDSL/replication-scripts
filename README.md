# replication-scripts
This repository hosts MEDSL's replication syntax for cleaning and quality assuring recent national elections.

Each file refers to a raw dataset that we cleaned and standardized to include in our election result datasets. We do not post those raw datasets online for two main reasons: (1) we do not want to risk confusion between the raw datasets and our cleaned and quality assured datasets, and (2) in some cases the raw data may belong to another organization. However, where official data are already available publicly online, we identify the source in the file ``source.txt``. In other cases, we are always happy to point users to the raw datasets, so if you want to know where to find raw data that a script refers to, please contact us directly.
